# Week 06 Challenge: Web APIs: Code Quiz

To help myself become familiar with these tests and give me a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s challenge invites me to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework has taught me all the skills I need to succeed in this challenge.

As I proceed in my journey to becoming a front-end web developer, it’s likely that I’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

## Description

This project takes on the 6th week challenge which is creating a code quiz web app.
